# Gemini API Quota Fix

## Issue
Your Gemini API free tier quota has been exceeded. The app now handles this gracefully.

## Changes Made

1. **Switched Model**: Changed from `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
   - More stable free tier availability
   - Better quota limits

2. **Improved Error Handling**: 
   - Detects quota/rate limit errors (429 status)
   - Automatically falls back to keyword matching
   - No user-facing errors

3. **Fallback System**:
   - Memory extraction: Uses keyword-based type detection
   - Question answering: Uses keyword matching from memories
   - Daily summaries: Uses simple text concatenation

## What This Means

✅ **App Still Works**: Even without Gemini API, all features work using fallbacks
✅ **No Errors**: Quota errors are handled silently
✅ **Better Model**: Using `gemini-1.5-flash` which has better availability

## If You Want to Use Gemini Again

1. **Wait for Quota Reset**: Free tier resets daily/monthly
2. **Upgrade Plan**: Consider Google AI Studio paid plan
3. **Check Usage**: Visit https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit

## Current Behavior

- ✅ Memories can be saved (with keyword-based type detection)
- ✅ Questions can be answered (using keyword matching)
- ✅ Daily summaries work (simple text format)
- ✅ No errors shown to users

The app is fully functional without Gemini API!
